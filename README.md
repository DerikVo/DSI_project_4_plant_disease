## Problem Statement:

[According to Adhikari, Oh, and Panthee (2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5666701/) they found that the world wide production of tomatoes is an estimated 161.7 million metric tons. This has an estimated evaluation of %59 billion dollars, of that the USA produces an estimated 13.2 million metrics tons-- placing third in total world production of tomatoes. According to the [USDA (2022)](https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2021/wild-potatoes-tapped-for-late-blight-guard-duty/) late blight has inflicted an estimated $6.7 billion dollars in annual losses that includes tomatoes and potatoes. 

The USDA defines blight as a fungus-like pathogen that destroys a plant's leaves, stem, fruit, or tubers. Adhikari et al. (2019) explains blight reproduces asexually, and that it essentially goes dormant in winter and infects plants in warm and humid conditions. They state the condia, or a spore [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/conidium), usually germinates at 8 to 32 celsius. Once these fungal spores grow they will eventually kill the host cells by producing toxins. These toxins and display symptoms such as "dark, small, necrotic, coalescing, and concentric lesions...on the leaf surface" (Adhikari et al., (2019). Additional, they state that lesions also appear on the stem and can extend to the flesh of the fruit.

Adhikari et al (2019) state the most common method of prevention of blight is through screening. However, they state that this can be labor intensive to identify and treat blight. Meeting this need the goal of this project is to use a neural network to correctly classify if a tomato plant is healthy, in the early stages of blight, or in the late stages of blight. With this tool we can pair it with machines to identify when a plant needs intervention. Furthermore, we can also work with engineers to build a machine to automatically apply treatment to infected plants.
